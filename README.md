# React Portfolio

## Description

The Portfolio App is a single-page web application built with React and JavaScript. In an interactive and visually appealing way, it showcases web developers' skills, projects, and achievements. By using this app, developers can showcase their work online to potential employers, clients, and collaborators.

The app displays personal details, technical skills, project highlights, and contact information with a focus on user experience and responsive design. Visitors can explore and understand the developer's capabilities by viewing descriptions, images, live demos, and links to source code for each project.
